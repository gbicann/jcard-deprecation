      <t>This document describes the reasons supporting jCard deprecation in RDAP and defines a roadmap for replacing jCard with a new contact representation called JSCard.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
<t>According to the feedback from RDAP Pilot WG <xref target="RDAP-PILOT-WG"/>, the most frequent concern about RDAP implementation at both server and client side is currently related to the handling of jCard (<xref target="RFC7095"/>). In fact, it is considered:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>unintuitive;</t>
<t>very complicated for both consumers and servers;</t>
<t>uncompliant with REST API standards;</t>
<t>affecting performance.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Such a feeling is not limited to RDAP implementers but is also shared by most of APIs producers and consumers dealing with jCard.</t>
<t>JSContact (<xref target="draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact"/>) includes a contact representation that is able to represent the same information as jCard more efficiently. In particular, it meets the requirements from RDAP implementers about representing multilingual information and unstructured data. Therefore, jCard might be deprecated and replaced by the contact card defined by JSContact in the RDAP responses.</t>

<t>This document describes a roadmap for achieving the transition from jCard to JSContact contact card.</t>
         
      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
   </section>
      
   <section anchor="JSContact" title="JSContact">

      <t>The JSContact specification defines a data model and JSON representation of contact card information that can be used for data storage and exchange in address book or directory applications. It aims to be an alternative to the vCard data format (<xref target="RFC6350"/>) and to be unambiguous, extendable and simple to process. In contrast with jCard, it is not a direct mapping from the vCard data model and expands semantics where appropriate.</t>

       <t>The JSContact specification declares two main objects:</t>
       <t><list style="symbols">
           <t>&quot;JSCard&quot;: a contact card;</t>
           <t>&quot;JSCardGroup&quot;: a collection of contact cards.</t>
       </list></t>

       <t>For the purpose of this document, only JSCard is considered.</t>

       <t>JSCard is more efficient than jCard. In fact, it:</t>

       <t><list style="symbols">
           <t>follows an object-oriented rather than array-oriented approach;</t>
           <t>is simple to process;</t>
           <t>requires no extra work in serialization/deserialization from/to a data model;</t>
           <t>includes no jagged arrays;</t>
           <t>prefers maps rather than arrays in implementing collections;</t>
           <t>is able to represent redacted contacts (both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;fullName&quot; properties are optional)</t>
       </list></t>

       <t>Some examples of mapping between jCard and JSCard are shown in <xref target="converting-jcard-into-jscard"/>.</t>

<section anchor="deprecation-best-practices" title="Best Practices in Deprecating a REST API Feature">

<t>Deprecation of a REST API feature is a process that should be executed as smartly as possible. Before introducing the basic principles guiding a deprecation process, it could be useful to clarify about the terms deprecation and sunsetting:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>Deprecating an API means it is not usable in its current form for the purpose intended. This usually means that a new version has been created, or the API provider no longer intends to support it.</t>
<t>Sunsetting is merely a period of time leading up to a deprecation. It is a period of limited support, while deprecation is the period in which support officially ends.  In the meantime, the support for an alternate feature replacing the old one might be provided. A sunsetting plan can be set up months or even years in advance of the deprecation announcement.</t>
</list></t>

<t>That being said, here are a few guidelines to deprecate a REST API feature:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>&quot;Communicating&quot;: REST API providers should announce the intended deprecation communicating the timeline and any other helpful information.</t>
<t>&quot;Planning a long enough sunset period&quot;: a good sunset period is important as it gives API consumers time to work on their clients. Such a period could consist of API updates to fit the future version.</t>
<t>&quot;Providing alternatives&quot;: when entering the sunset period, there may be a provision for elements like redirect URIs, migration endpoints, etc., but, at the same time, the API might still respond to old fashioned requests in order to guarantee backward compatibility for a limited period.</t>
</list></t>
      </section>

<section anchor="rdap-features-supporting-deprecation" title="RDAP Features Supporting a Deprecation Process">

<t>RDAP enables servers' communication to clients through notices. A notice can include a set of links which can be used to provide clients with hints and documentation. For the purpose of this document, two link relation types have been used:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
    <t>&quot;deprecation&quot; as described in <xref target="draft-dalal-deprecation-header"/>.</t>
    <t>&quot;alternate&quot; as described in <xref target="RFC8288"/>;</t>
</list></t>

<t>The information about the specifications used in the construction of the response is also described by the rdapConformance tags.</t>
<t>Clients are able to ask servers for RDAP features by using appropriate query parameters as described in <xref target="RFC7482"/>.</t>
      </section>

<section anchor="jcard-deprecation-roadmap" title="jCard Deprecation Roadmap">

<t>The roadmap for jCard replacement in RDAP responses includes four contiguous stages each one corresponding to as many alternatives in providing the contact card. During the roadmap, the presence of &quot;jscard_level_0&quot; tag in the rdapConformance array means that JSCard is returned instead of jCard. The time format used in notifying clients about this roadmap is defined in <xref target="RFC3339"/>.</t>
<section anchor="jcard-deprecation-roadmap-stages" title="Stages">

    <t>Here in the following the four stages are reported in detail:</t>

    <t><list style="empty">
        <t>Stage 1 - JSCard unimplemented</t>
        <t>This stage corresponds to providing jCard as default contact card ([RFC7483]). The RDAP server is not able to provide an alternate contact card. The rdapConformance array contains only the &quot;rdap_level_0&quot; tag.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        <t>Stage 2 - JSCard sunset</t>
        <t>This stage corresponds to providing jCard as default contact card but the RDAP server is able to alternatively return JSCard if the client sets the query parameter &quot;jscard&quot; to 1/true/yes. The rdapConformance array contains the &quot;rdap_level_0&quot; tag but also the &quot;jscard_level_0&quot; tag if JSCard is requested.</t>
        <t>The RDAP server is recommended to return a notice titled &quot;JSCard sunset end&quot;. Such a notice should include a description reporting the JSCard sunset end time and two links:
        <list style="symbols">
                <t>&quot;deprecation&quot;: a link to a URI-identified resource documenting the jCard deprecation;</t>
                <t>&quot;alternate&quot;: if JSCard is not requested, a link to the JSCard version of same resource as identified by the current query string plus the parameter &quot;jscard&quot; set to 1/true/yes (<xref target="stage2-example1"/>); otherwise, only the &quot;deprecation&quot; link is provided (<xref target="stage2-example2"/>).</t>
         </list></t>
